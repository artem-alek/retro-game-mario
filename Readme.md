# First Object-Oriented Javascript Game
  *I do not own any rights to this game and retrieved all my sprites on a public domain.*

### What I Learned
* How to setup data flow and functions to update per frame.
* Mario, Donkeykong, and Barrels are all objects that have their own data.
* Learned more about doing a MVC setup.
